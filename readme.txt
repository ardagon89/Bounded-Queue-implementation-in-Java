How to compile and run the code:
-------
1) The command prompt path should be in "sxa190016" directory

The class BoundedQueue models the functionalities of
a bounded queue and implements offer(), poll(), peek() and other methods. We have used
the main function to run and test the class functions. 

The procedure to run is as follows:

When u run the main function, it 
1. creates a boundedqueue and an integer array. 
2. Then it inserts 3 items to the boundedqueue and 
3. checks the size of the queue.
4. checks if the queue is empty
5. removes 3 items from the queue
6. Checks if it is empty
7. Tries to remove still more items
8. Checks if it is still empty
9. Inserts more items in the queue
10. Checks the size of the queue
11. Tries to insert 1 more item in the queue
12. Checks the size of the queue now
13. Tries to insert few more items
14. Clears the queue
15. Checks the size of the queue now
16. Converts and saves the array in an integer array 
17. Prints the array
18. Tries some items
19. Converts and save the array in the integer array 
20. Prints the array
